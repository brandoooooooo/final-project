  Required Questions

A. Summarize your proposed three features (your features might have
changed slightly after the proposal, so this is so your advisor knows
the current status of your plans):

I changed my plan for the project from a playable game of chess to just a program that plays out a past game of chess
using a text file as input. I felt like implementing all the rules of chess will take too long, especially things such
as checking if a move is legal or not, as well as obscure rules such as en passant or pins, which would require
a lot of if statements and implementing some kind of system to check every square that a piece is able to move to.

Feature 1.
Piece: Data type that stores a piece's x-y position and image, which contains methods to place the piece, move, and
others

Feature 2.
ChessBoard: Data type that stores an array of pieces, and actually creates the chess board and other thing such as
placing a square to hide a piece when moving or returning the piece at a certain position on the board

Feature 3.
Game: Reads in the moves from a text file and does the moves. Includes static methods to read in the pieces from a text
file as well as the moves, so in theory you could play out another board game such as checkers if you changed the
images and used the same move format for the input.

B. Summarize what you have implemented for each feature:

Feature 1.
Piece: I think I am done implementing this, as it was quite simple. All I needed to do for moving was to update the
x and y instance variables for a move.

Feature 2.
ChessBoard: I have also implemented this

Feature 3.
Game: I have implemented the method that reads in the pieces file, but not the moves file yet, and I also have not
implemented the main method that actually plays out the game yet.

Other Code (optional, in case you have extra code).

C. Estimate what you have left to implement for each feature:

Feature 1.
** Write here **

Feature 2.
** Write here **

Feature 3.
Game: I still have to implement reading in the moves and moving the pieces, as well as something that shows
     the captured pieces and relative material advantage.

Other Code (optional, in case you have extra code)
